# ✈️ AeroForesight-EU

**European aviation intelligence & foresight platform** — predicting flight-delay
risk, optimising hub networks, mapping business dynamics, and forecasting the
2040 sustainability-cost future of European aviation.

Built as an end-to-end, deployable MLOps project that combines **Deep Learning**,
**Reinforcement Learning**, an **LLM foresight layer**, and a full **MLOps**
pipeline (feature store → training → gating → registry → drift monitoring →
serving → dashboard).

---

## 🔴 LIVE mode (zero-install, runs on Node)

The `live/` app streams **real aircraft** over Europe and predicts the future in
your browser — no Python, no build step, **zero dependencies** (Node built-ins only).

```bash
cd live
node server.js          # → http://localhost:8787
```

What it does, end to end:

```
OpenSky /states/all (live)  ──poll every 10s──►  ingest.js  ──►  data/captures/*.jsonl   (data capture)
        │  (auto-fallback to physics-lite simulator if offline)        │
        ▼                                                              ▼
   predict.js  (delay-risk · live EU-ETS carbon cost · 2040 scenarios)  ──►  SSE /stream  ──►  live dashboard
```

| Layer | File | What it delivers |
|---|---|---|
| **Live capture** | `live/ingest.js` | Polls OpenSky (Europe bbox), normalises state vectors, appends snapshots to `data/captures/`. Falls back to a seeded simulator when the network is down. |
| **Futuristic prediction** | `live/predict.js` | Per-flight next-hour delay risk, live CO₂ burn + EU-ETS € cost, and a 2035→2040 scenario projection (Baseline / Green Push / High Growth) computed off the **current** sky. |
| **Streaming server** | `live/server.js` | Aggregates each snapshot and pushes it to browsers over **Server-Sent Events**; REST at `/api/snapshot`, `/api/forecast`, `/api/health`. |
| **Live dashboard** | `live/public/index.html` | Real-time European airspace map, KPI tiles, rolling delay-risk timeline, top-risk flights, and an interactive 2040 what-if — all vanilla JS/canvas, no CDN. |

Verified live: ~2,600 real aircraft tracked, LHR busiest hub, 2040 EU-ETS bill
projected at **€16.7bn** (baseline) rising to **€18.1bn** under Green Push.

> The Python stack below (`src/aeroforesight/…`) is the full offline MLOps
> reference implementation (DL/RL/LLM + training pipeline). Use **LIVE mode** for
> a runnable, streaming demo; use the Python stack when you have Python 3.10+.

## The real-world problem

European carriers, airports and regulators need to anticipate:

| Question | Who cares | AeroForesight answers with |
|---|---|---|
| Which flights will arrive late, and why? | Airline OCC, airports | **DL** delay predictor |
| Where should we invest limited schedule buffer? | Network planning | **RL** buffer-allocation agent |
| How concentrated & connected is the network? | Regulators, strategy | **Business analytics** (HHI, connectivity, revenue-at-risk) |
| What does 2040 cost under EU-ETS + ReFuelEU SAF mandates? | CFO, sustainability | **Scenario forecaster** (baseline / green_push / high_growth) |
| What should leadership actually do? | Executives | **LLM** foresight briefing |

The demo runs on a **synthetic European network** (12 hubs — LHR, CDG, FRA, AMS,
MAD, …; 6 carriers) generated with realistic causal structure (congestion,
weather, distance, low-cost turnaround pressure), so it works fully offline.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. install (core + optional extras)
pip install -e ".[dl,llm,dashboard,dev]"     # or: make install

# 2. run the full pipeline (generates data, trains DL+RL, forecasts, briefs)
python -m aeroforesight.mlops.pipeline        # or: make pipeline

# 3. serve predictions
uvicorn aeroforesight.serving.api:app --reload   # http://localhost:8000/docs

# 4. explore the dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py         # http://localhost:8501
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
# API       → http://localhost:8000/docs
# Dashboard → http://localhost:8501
```

> The platform runs **without any API key**. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`
> (copy `.env.example`) to turn the templated briefing into a full Claude-written
> narrative. Model defaults to `claude-opus-4-8`.

## Components

### 🧠 Deep Learning — delay predictor (`models/dl_delay.py`)
Feed-forward net predicting P(arrival delay > 15 min) from network, weather and
congestion features. PyTorch backend with a transparent scikit-learn fallback,
so it trains anywhere. Reports validation AUC; gated in the pipeline.

### 🎯 Reinforcement Learning — network optimiser (`models/rl_network.py`)
Tabular Q-learning agent that allocates a limited pool of *schedule buffer*
across congested hubs to minimise cascading-delay cost net of utilisation cost.
`recommend_allocation()` returns a concrete plan for today's hub congestion.

### 🔭 Futuristic forecasting (`models/forecast.py`)
Deterministic 2040 scenario paths for traffic growth, SAF adoption (ReFuelEU),
EU-ETS carbon price, CO₂, and the resulting green cost (carbon bill + SAF premium).

### 🏢 Business analytics (`models/business.py`)
Route economics, carrier market share, hub concentration (**HHI**), network
connectivity, and delay **revenue-at-risk** (EU261-style exposure).

### 💬 LLM foresight briefing (`models/llm_insights.py`)
Feeds the structured outputs to Claude (`claude-opus-4-8`, adaptive thinking,
streamed) to produce an executive briefing. Falls back to a deterministic
template offline.

### ⚙️ MLOps (`mlops/`)
- `pipeline.py` — orchestrates the whole run and writes `artifacts/foresight_report.json`
- `registry.py` — file-based model registry (MLflow-swappable)
- `monitoring.py` — PSI drift detection + performance gate

```

---

## Tests

```bash
pytest -q        # or: make test
```

Smoke tests cover every layer (data → DL → RL → forecast → business → monitoring
→ briefing) and run in seconds using the scikit-learn fallback.

## Notes & disclaimers

- Data is **synthetic** (no real airline/airport feeds); scenario numbers are
  illustrative, not investment advice.
- Swap `data/generate.py` for real OpenSky / Eurocontrol / OAG connectors to go
  from demo to production without touching the model or serving code.
